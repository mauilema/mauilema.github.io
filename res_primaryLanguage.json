      "description": "My name is Jose. I'm a highly skilled software engineer specializing in web and mobile development. My technical toolbox includes ES6 JavaScript, React, Express, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and Git, along with experience in Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, React Native, AWS, and Firebase. I've had the pleasure of contributing to exciting projects like City Diary, a React Native app that lets users record and share audio based on their location, and Fullstack Spirits, a user-friendly React e-commerce website. During my software developer internship at Thoughtworks, I honed my skills in Pair Programming, TDD, and Clean Code while building a full-stack web app. With a Certificate in Fullstack Web Development from Fullstack Academy and an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, I'm committed to delivering top-notch solutions. Let's create something amazing together in the world of software engineering!",
